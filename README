BB10 Qt Components
==================
Theme for the BB10 Qt Components port, located at:
https://gitorious.org/~martink/qt-components/martinks-ineans-qt-components

What was changed
================
- high-DPI constants (are they even used ?)
- upscaled switch & main toolbar backgrounds

Making the theme smaller
========================
The whole theme has about 20 MB and contains thousands of files. BB10 applications currently have to bundle
all external resources. Fortunatelly, the theme can be cut down to only the stuff needed by the application.
- remove the *.idx files
- remove all icons that are not needed by you applications from the images folder
- remove all folders other than "theme" from the "meegotouch" folder
- in the meegotouch/theme folder, leave only the "basement" folder
- you can also by trial and error rumove further stuff, such as inverted versions of icons if you are suing the light theme
- if you remove some graphics that is needed by mistake, check the log for error message, they show what image is missing

How this theme haas been created: 
================================

1. Add custom theme files
-------------------------
Create custom index.theme and constants.init based on meegotouch-theme
so it could be parsed by fremantle qt-components

2. Fetch blanco theme content list
-----------------------------------
On QtSimulator's harmattanthemes directory invoke:

# fetch.py idx.txt blanco

This generates a file with a list of current images, where are
located, type and dimmensions. copy idx.txt file to base directory

3. Remove spurious images
--------------------------
On qt-components-base-icons remove duplicates:

# cd icons && rm -rf png theme

4. Merge available image
-------------------------       
on base directory invoke:

# merge.py idx.txt merge.txt /path/to/qt-components-base-icons
   /path/to/meegotouch-theme-graphics /path/to/meegotouch-theme

this command merge images. In case that multiple source provide same
images, it gives priority to the first one found. declaration order is
important

meegotouch-theme used commit is c5c2004cf4d66ca0ab077e349699c1c736180eca

5. Verify that there's no copyright theme
-----------------------------------------
# verify.py base /path/to/qt-components-base-icons
   /path/to/meegotouch-theme-graphics /path/to/meegotouch-theme

6. AutoGenerate missing images
-------------------------------
# generate.py idx.txt generated.txt /base
